- By not using .set() or .pushObject() the DOM will not rerender
- Templates are chunks of HTML with dynamic elements that get compiled by the application and inserted
into the DOM. 
- check spelling of handlebars properties if something isnt working as these errors dont show up

- export default exports a single value from the module
- named exports exports several thing from the module

- {{link-to "Songs" "songs"}} first param link text, second param link for URL
- The properties in the template need to be defined on the controller, since that is the context the template is rendered with.

- EmberObject.extend creates a subclass of EmberObject so it inherits all the functionality EmberObject defines. We does this to add properties and methods to it to make the class implement the logic we want to use. 
- to create instances of the EmberObject we have made, use the .create() method. 

- this._super(...arguments) calls the same method (i.e init) in the superclass with the same arguments.

- ember generate route bands/band --path=':user_id'

- dasherize() replaces underscores, spaces, or camelCase with dashes

- findBy() method finds the first item whose property (passed as the first argument) matches the value passed as the second argument

- computing functions are only run if any of the dependent keys change
- When the value of a dependent key changes, the CP is marked as stale. The next time we access its value (the CP), the computing function is run and its returned value becomes the new value of the CP

- If a path is not explicitly defined for a route, it is equal to its name.
- the routing structure makes it possible for lower levels to access data that was retrieved higher up in the chain.
- modelFor() fetches the model of a parent route that had already been activated. Since the Ember router enters routes starting at the root and proceeds downwards, this means that any route that is “above” the current route in the tree can be used as the parameter for modelFor(). 

- templates default is {{outlet}} if this is all the template needs the file is not needed.




WORK IDEAS

- use modelFor() for when using findRecord() in model
- use modelFor() to get ember-models-table data
