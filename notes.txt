- EmberObject.extend creates a subclass of EmberObject so it inherits all the functionality EmberObject defines. We does this to add properties and methods to it to make the class implement the logic we want to use.

- this._super(...arguments) calls the same method (i.e init) in the superclass with the same arguments.
